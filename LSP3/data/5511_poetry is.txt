poetry is about the desire of
good attitude and lovely feelings
a poem can tell lovely words and 
scary thoughts but it all makes out to be
a lovely sequence if there where more
lovely poems maybe they could change
the world a good poem can be heard
for positive devotion hear the loveliness
of poetry and feel the word
